# Hi there! I'm **Shree** :wave:
 

## Currently I'm in 4th year *Biology* with some Comp Sci electives under my belt 
 

### My two truths and a lie are: 

1. I have been a competitive swimmer since high school
2. I was a child model for 2 years 
3. I am a non-caffeine person in a family of tea drinkers 

### Fun Fact I am obessed with Taylor Swift. This is my [favourite playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2VUZe0qm0cpT1T3LrWfoFV?si=cb1c481ccbff4302) in my current music rotation :musical_score:
